## Hi there 👋

## Myself

I'm Lucie, but I'm mostly known as _luclu7_ online (sometimes with a capital L, sometimes not, it doesn't really matter). I'm a 19 years old human in french university.

Languages spoken: I'm pretty fluent in English and I'm a french native

Pronouns: she/they

## 💻 computer-related stuff

I'm still a student so almost everything I do is on my free time. I mostly do stuff in JavaScript (/Node.js) and Swift. Sometimes Python but arg, it's not for me. Web is bloated, backend is fun.

🚊 I love public transit and to build transit-related apps using (open) data

Simple web is cute.

If you want me to help you on something I know, don't hesitate to reach out!

Also:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a lot of projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basically everything, from life to electrical engineering
