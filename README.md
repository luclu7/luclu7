## Hi there 👋

## Myself

I'm Lucie, but I'm mostly known as _luclu7_ online (sometimes with a capital L, sometimes not, it doesn't really matter). I'm a 18 years old human in french university.

Languages spoken: I'm pretty fluent in English and I'm a french native

Pronouns: she/they

## 💻 computer-related stuff

I'm still a student so almost everything I do is on my free time. I mostly do stuff in Go(lang), JavaScript (/Node.js), but I can do some Python or C sometimes (basic things only tho). Web is bloated (and hard), backend is way more fun.

Vim user, IDEs are too bloated.

Simple web is cute.

I don't love frontend JavaScript frameworks.

Sometimes I'm also a system administrator, mostly at @anjaraeu.

If you want me to help you on something I know, don't hesitate to reach out!

Also:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a lot of projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basically everything, from life to electrical engineering
- 😅 I'm still young so I make a LOT of mistakes sometimes, I'm quite sensitive so please kind
