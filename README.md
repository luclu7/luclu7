## ðŸ’» computer-related stuff

I'm still a student so almost everything I do is on my free time. I mostly do stuff in JavaScript (/TS/Node.js), Swift for iOS, and a bit of Python. I do love Vue.js, but React is fine.

ðŸšŠ I love public transit and to build transit-related apps using (open) data

Simple web is cute.
