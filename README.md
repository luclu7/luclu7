## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Myself

I'm Lucie, but I'm mostly known as _luclu7_ online (sometimes with a capital L, sometimes not, it doesn't really matter). I'm a 18 years old human in french high school.

Languages spoken: I'm pretty fluent in English and I'm a french native

Pronouns: she/they

## ðŸ’» computer-related stuff

I'm still a student so everything I do is on my free time. I mostly do stuff in Go(lang), but I can do some Python or C sometimes (basic things only tho), or even some JS sometimes. Web is bloated (and hard), backend is way more fun.

Vim user, IDEs are too bloated.

Simple web is cute.

I don't love frontend JavaScript frameworks btw. Frontend is just not for me.

Sometimes I'm also a system administrator, mostly at @anjaraeu.

If you want me to help you on something I know, don't hesitate to ask!

Also:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a lot of projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning basically everything, from life to electrical engineering
- ðŸ˜… I'm still young so I make a LOT of mistakes sometimes, I'm quite sensitive so please kind
