## 💻 computer-related stuff

I'm still a student so almost everything I do is on my free time. I mostly do stuff in JavaScript (/TS/Node.js), Swift for iOS, and a bit of Python. I learnt to love React, but Vue.js is still in my ❤️

🚊 I love public transit and to build transit-related apps using (open) data

Simple web is cute.

- 🔭 I’m work on a lot of projects
- 🌱 I’m learning basically everything, from life to electrical engineering
